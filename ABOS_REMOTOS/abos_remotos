These exercises incorporate remote exploitation, which implies the novelty of interacting with a server by creating a connection through a port.
•	ABO R1 Remote Stack overflow, in order to exploit it you need to make a connection to the server on the specific port and send data necessary to override a return address to redirect the flow, but to achieve this the server checks some requirements of how it should be formed the package.
•	ABO R2 Integer overflow that is produced by declaring variables that consider the sign (int type) and ends up overflowing the stack until stepping on the SEH.
•	ABOX It is the most complicated of the remotes, it has many filters that force the attacker to manage to send the shellcode and be able to jump to execute it. The vulnerability is an integer overflow.
