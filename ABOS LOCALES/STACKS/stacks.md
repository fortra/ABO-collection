These exercises serve to become familiar with the tools, learn how the stack works,
delve into assembly language, the hexadecimal number system, the "little endian" convention, among other things.

* The stack1, stack2 and stack3 are similar. The student achieves the objective by filling a buffer
    to a certain place and validates a comparison to achieve the "YouWin" message.
* Stack4 presents a new difficulty because the value with which it is compared contains a character that represents the 
    line break with which it will have to look for a different solution than the previous ones to achieve the objective.

* Stack2_x64 is stack2 compiled in 64 bits.
